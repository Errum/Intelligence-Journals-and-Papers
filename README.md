A list of Per-Reviewed Journals, Conferences and Blogs on intelligence and Cybersecurity
Each listing is compared to a Norwegian "impact" system from 0 to 2 where:
* **Level 2** is the highest level. The scientific panels carries out the yearly nomination for level 2. 
* **Level 1** are publication channels considered to satisfy the minimum requirement to be counted as scientific (external peer review, scientific editorial board and minimum national authorship).
* **Level 0** means that the publication channel has been considered, but rejected. The publication channel is not approved and publishing in it will not yield publication points. 
* **Level x** are publication channels where we are in doubt whether the publication channel should be approved or not, in light of current criteria and available information.
